The Dailies - A Personal Game HubThis is a simple, clean, and self-contained webpage designed to host a personal gallery of daily online games. It's built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript, requiring no setup or build process.FeaturesCustom Game List: Easily edit a single file (index.html) to add, remove, or modify your list of daily games.Daily Countdown: A clean timer at the top counts down to midnight (local time), when most daily games reset.Played/Unplayed Tracking: Mark games as "played" for the day with a simple click. This status is saved in your browser's local storage and resets automatically each day.Favorites System: Mark your most-loved games as favorites for quick access via a special filter.Tag-Based Filtering: Assign tags (like "word", "music", "puzzle") to each game and use the automatically generated filter buttons to sort your list.Fully Responsive: The layout works beautifully on desktop, tablets, and mobile devices.How to CustomizeAll customization happens directly within the index.html file.Open index.html in a text editor.Find the <script> tag at the bottom of the file.The very first thing inside the script is a JavaScript array called const games = [...].To add a new game, add a new entry to the array like this:{ 
  name: "New Game Name", 
  url: "[https://example.com](https://example.com)", 
  description: "A short description of the game.", 
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"] 
},
That's it! Save the file, and your changes will be live. The tag filter buttons are generated automatically from the tags you provide.Made with Gemini
